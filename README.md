# Challenge: Bochum goes LBD
## Champions:	Sven Zentgraf

## Number of people per team: 
4-5

## Anticipated workload:
approx. 24 hours per person, including the time for preparation of the presentation

## Challenge description:

## Challenger research questions:
1. Mapping of the data model from point 1 as an ontology. Conversion of the data in Excel into 
instances of the previously created ontology. Creation of a set of SPARQL queries for querying and 
manipulating the data. 
2. Linking the data from point 1 with the information from the wiki from point 2, in particular, the 
information on the geographical location of the individual colliery towers for further processing of 
the task. In addition, further information such as the images and descriptions of the colliery 
towers provided in the wiki can be integrated into the database.
3. Enter the collected and semantic information into a map tool such as Open Street Maps and 
visualize the data.
4. Retrieving the areas of the mining towers from maps of the NRW geoportal to find out how the 
former colliery areas are used today. Analysis of the conversion of the colliery areas for mining
towers in the Bochum city area.

## Datasets available:  
1. Historical extraction information from various mining companies based in the Ruhrgebiet in 
tabular form from the years 1894 to approx. 1930. The data is provided by a doctoral student 
from the Chair of Economic and Business History and is available in Excel workbooks.
Information includes company names, quantities mined, type of coal mined, and goods 
produced.

2. Colliery map with former colliery towers in the Ruhr area
http://www.zechenkarte.de/wiki/index.php?title=Hauptseite). Further information on the 
respective colliery towers is available within a wiki, including information on longitude and 
latitude. The information on the locations of the colliery towers is also visualized using a map 
based on Open Street Maps.

3. The NRW geoportal is an online service provided by the state government of North RhineWestphalia. It provides access to geographical data, maps, and services relating to the federal 
state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in Germany. Users can access various types of 
geoinformation via the portal, including topographical maps, aerial photographs, environmental 
data, and much more. This information can be used for planning, environmental protection, 
education, and research, among other things, to gain a better understanding of the geographical 
structure and current situation in NRW
